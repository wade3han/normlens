# NormLens: Reading Books is Great, But Not if You Are Driving! Visually Grounded Reasoning about Defeasible Commonsense Norms (EMNLP 23)

![NormLens Teaser](./assets/teaser_figure.png)

**Commonsense norms are dependent on their context. What if the context is given by image?**

Our NormLens dataset is a multimodal benchmark to evaluate how well models align with human reasoning about defeasible commonsense norms, incorporating visual grounding.

## How Can I Use the Dataset?

Stay tuned for release of codes and dataset!

### Evaluating Models on NormLens-HA/MA

Work in progress.

### Finetuning Models with Synthesized NormLens

Work in progress.

## How Can We Collect More Data?

![NormLens Pipeline](./assets/dataset_pipeline.png)

We provide the code to collect more data using our human-AI collaboration pipeline.

Work in progress.
